      own ways.
    - Tony's off lifting, Ollie decided to count every leaf on a tree, and Kev's...
    - Well, Kevin's trying his best.
    - Gavin's still taking the Holy Board for a spin or two.
    - And for me, well, I'm keeping my mind at ease.
    - ...
    - Hey, listen, Champ. I know it ain't easy.

    - We all got our foils in life. Ya know, your opposite.
    - The whole balance of the universe type beat, ya dig?
    - The darker the night, the brighter the stars.
    - Now listen, I ain't calling ol' Gavin 'the darkness', but you catch my drift.
    - We got our polar opposites in life, and that's ok, ya feel?
    - 'A magnet can''t exist without a north and south pole: the two opposites livin''
      under the same canopy.'
    - ...At least I think that's how mangets work. I've never seen one tbh.
    - 'But listen here, Champ: We all got our special lil quirks to us, ya feel.'
    - And one of yours is being the champion of the Holy Board.
    - I know it might not feel like it right now, but that's your destiny,
    - The lil quirk of your future.
    - 'Everybody''s got their destiny lined up for ''em. '
    - The moment I saw you shreddin' for the first time, I knew that your destiny
      was to be the greatest skater this jungle's ever seen.
    - Regardless though, I see Gavin's destiny all laid out.
    - And I can tell ya he's straying from the path.
    - You wanna know his destiny?
    - Can't say...
    - It'd spoil the next adventure if you catch my drift...
